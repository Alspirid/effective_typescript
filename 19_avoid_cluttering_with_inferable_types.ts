/*
Things to Remember

Avoid writing type annotations when TypeScript can infer the same type.
Ideally your code has type annotations in function/method signatures but not on local variables in their bodies.
Consider using explicit annotations for object literals and function return types even when they can be inferred. This will help prevent implementation errors from surfacing in user code.
