/* 
Things to Remember

Aliasing can prevent TypeScript from narrowing types. If you create an alias for a variable, use it consistently.
Use destructuring syntax to encourage consistent naming.
Be aware of how function calls can invalidate type refinements on properties. Trust refinements on local variables more than on properties.
